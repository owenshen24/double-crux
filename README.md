# Double Crux

[Hosted on AppSpot here.](http://double-crux.appspot.com/).

Double Crux was a final project for Google CSSI 2017.

The stylings are based off the Skeleton boilerplate.

The actual double crux philosophy is from the [Center for Applied Rationality](http://rationality.org/). There is an extensive writeup on exactly how it works here.
