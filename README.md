# Double Crux

[Hosted on AppSpot here.](http://double-crux.appspot.com/)

Double Crux was a final project for [Google CSSI 2017](https://edu.google.com/resources/programs/computer-science-summer-institute/).

The stylings are based off the [Skeleton boilerplate](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton#colophon).

The actual double crux philosophy is from the [Center for Applied Rationality](http://rationality.org/). There is an extensive writeup on exactly how it works [here](http://rationality.org/resources/updates/2016/double-crux).

As a forum, Double Crux is designed for discussions between two people. It has split-screen and recursive functionality, putting each person's points on one side, and allowing for direct responses to individual points.

Here's how it works, in a nutshell:

**Step 1:** Click on the Log In button and sign in with an existing Google account.

**Step 2:** Click Add New Discussion to get started.

**Step 3:** Enter in a title and your partner's email. Note that they need to have logged in before at least once in order for you to add them to the discussion.

**Step 4:** Once you navigate over to your Profile, you'll see a list of all discussions you are a part of. Clicking on one will take you to that discussion's page.

**Step 5:** From there, you can add new Cruxes to the discussion, change your side's title, and delete existing cruxes.

**Step 6:** The blue Recurse button allows you to take a Crux and start a new subdiscussion that will be linked to the Crux.

**Step 7:** In any nested subdiscussion, the back button will bring you up a level.

**Step 8:** Once you've recursed once, a new Recurse button will appear under the corresponding Crux that allows anyone viewing to also travel deeper into the discussion.
